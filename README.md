# Career History
Here is a history of my career in Software, IT and Electronics: a quick summary, then a list of companies starting with the latest.

I graduated from Delcastle Technical High School in 1977 with a vocation in Radio and Television Repair. From eighth grade I wanted to learn electronics and when I worked for a TV repair shop as a senior, wanted to further my studies. I chose the U.S. Army having come from a poor family who discouraged me from seeking college. Then it was as a 33S Intercept Systems Repair/Electronic Warfare Specialist that my knowledge of electronics formed my career. I left the Army in 1982 and repaired radio and digital electronics until 1995. In 1981, I bought an Apple II after learning BASIC on a friend's computer. I learned 6502 assembly language and BASIC, but never thought I'd leave electronics. I studied C and C++ between then and 1994, along with dabbling with Forth, LISP and Scheme.
I learned about Linux in 1994 and with an interest in getting on the Internet, studied Unix administration. Became a Unix/Linux administrator in 1995 and was the Web Master for the Libertarian Party of Maryland from 1996 to 1998. This was HTML and Perl-CGI, with CSV sent to the party's database administrator. SunOS and Solaris were the OSes, then later on, Linux as it fell more in favor. Most of my duties were scripting in Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and some PHP as well. When Java came out, I wrote some Applet games for my own website. I became a Linux Systems Engineer from 2000 to 2005. I wrote plugins for Netcool, Nagios and Big Brother monitors.
In 2005 I got my opportunity to be a Software Engineer, mostly with Java, occasionally with PL/SQL, Perl, Python, and a little JavaScript. From 1984 - 2000, then from 2003 until 2016, I was a Federal Government contractor. I switched from contract-to-contract and company-to-company when needed be, but as I would work with Java-based front ends like Struts and Java Server Faces. Eventually, the focus became the back end with HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the front end. I left government work and moved to Florida in 2016.
In 2017, coming back was a desire but until 2019 I had no focus. JavaScript became my focus, as well as some full-stack projects with WordPress, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. Focus has been on learning JavaScript, data structures, algorithms, and Python through Udemy and YouTube seminars.

# October 2007 - November 2016 Software Engineer at Amches Inc.
Worked with RESTful calls with JSON responses for a team with Java and Spring Security for the back end for one project. Worked with a customer application using MySQL, Tomcat and Spring Framework. Another client wanted reports from data sheets, artifacts and analysis data, using Java and Java Server Faces. Built image and data repository from Java for another client. Another contract needed data analysis and server monitoring. Used Perl, Python, Nagios and MySQL for the project.

# September 2005 - October 2007 Software Engineer at Essex/Northrop Grumman
Developed administration tools for migrating hundreds of users from Solaris to Windows 2000. Developed two-way SSL PKI tools using Java, Struts and Oracle. Worked with building reports for a legacy system using plain Java objects.

# August 2001 - October 2007 Systems Engineer at Digicon/Centrivity
At first, I worked for the commercial part of the company (Centrivity) until we were all to get on government contracts. On the Internet Service part of Centrivity, I wrote the billing tool for the company that calculated and displayed the 95th percentile of the customers' bandwidths and caiculated the cost based on each customer's contract. Perl and RRDTool were the primary tools for the project. Also wrote a TFTP server in Perl that used a table to determine what configuration to put on a router based on that router's IP address. Provided Unix administration and HP OpenView Network Node Manager support for a government client.

# March 2000 - June 2001 Systems Engineer at Logictier
Startup company that went bust in May of 2001, provided second-tier and monitoring support for a web-managing service. Provided plugins for a Netcool monitoring system. Set up NetSaint (later to become Nagios) and Big Brother monitors as well. Tools and languages included Perl, SNMP, Python and Sybase.

# November 1995 - March 2000 Unix Administrator Keane Federal Systems
Supported customers who needed SunOS and Solaris administration on dozens of servers all over the world. Also supported the watch team and the communications center who monitored the connections to the world. An example of support was when HP Openview NNM reported a particular connection down. The comms center would reset the connection and all would be well, but this happened to the connection up to 100 times per day. Since the customer didn't see the problem, he wanted proof. Using Tcl/TK, I collected the data from the Openview logs and wrote the report. It turned out to be a board with a revision number that wasn't supported in this system. I also recommended that Apache be used over NCSA web servers and I automated the daily backups I performed when moving to another project.

# 1996 - 1998 Webmaster for the Libertarian Party of Maryland
Provided the first web presense for the LPMD working alongside the provider of the web server. The front end provided a form that sent email to the chair (and myself), CSV data to the database administrator, and information back to the submitter. Also collaborated with a team of good-guy hackers to demonstrate anonymity and privacy at the Libertarian Party Convention in 1996.

# November 1992 - November 1995 Electronics Technician at Mantech Systems
Electronics work meant repairing old Intel 286 and 386 boards for the government. This equipment was only thrown away if unrepairable. Wrote a program to interface a mouse on 286 machines running MS-DOS, but wrote scripts to test graphics cards, network cards, monitors, and keyboards on these motherboards. Also wrote the schematics for the new comms lines for a contract overseas.

# January 1990 - November 1992 Electronics Technician for ACC Systems
Repaired BBN X.25 packet-switching nodes for the government. X.25 was already being replaced, but at least one network was still running. First time experiencing Unix.

# March 1984 - December 1989 Electronics Technician for Aiken Advanced Systems
Testing and component-level repair of manufactured boards for a RF Matrix Switching System. Later provided maintenance and guaranteed 48-hour final acceptance tests for these systems. Wrote formulas for Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet that calcualated cable lengths for electrical-length matching of elements in an antenna array. Also wrote HP-BASIC programs for testing boards in the system with HP analyzers and RF generators.

# October 1977 - August 1982 Specialist Four, US Army
Learned elaborate RF and digital electronics for tactical and field service systems. Worked both tactically for the Fourth Infantry Division and for a Field Station in Germany. Worked on radio receivers, transmitters, jammers, direction finders, and receiving systems.

# August 1976 - June 1977 Radio and TV Repair for Kral Music Service Center
While a senior in high school I repaired radios and televisions, and went on service calls for this service shop.
